## Loops, conditionals, recursive functions (5 pts)
1) The proposed function is at file [answers_module.py](answers_module.py) and the function is called `myrec`.
Explain your function here if needed (may help you to get partial credit if the function is not correct)

```python
def myrec(x):
    # A beautiful well documented recursive function goes here.
```

## IO (5 pts)

2) The proposed function is at file [answers_module.py](answers_module.py) and the function is called `basic_io`.
Explain your function here if needed and describe an example of it (may help you to get partial credit if the function is not correct)

```python
def basic_io(x):
    # A beautiful well documented function goes here.
```

# ... same for the next two questions
